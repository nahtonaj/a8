	 * At every step, you know only the current planet's ID, the IDs of
	 * neighboring planets, and the strength of the signal from Planet X at
	 * each planet.

	 * In this rescuePhase,
	 * (1) In order to get information about the current state, use functions
	 * currentID(), neighbors(), and signal().
	 *
	 * (2) Use method onPlanetX() to know if you are on Planet X.
	 *
	 * (3) Use method moveTo(int id) to move to a neighboring planet with the
	 * given ID. Doing this will change state to reflect your new position.
